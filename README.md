# To-Do List Application

## Introduction

This Python script implements a straightforward To-Do List application using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLite for database management. The application provides a user-friendly interface to manage tasks efficiently.

## Features and Functionality

- **Adding Tasks**: Easily add tasks to the list by entering them in the provided field and clicking the "ADD" button.
- **Marking Tasks as Done**: Select a task and click the "MARK AS DONE" button to mark it as completed.
- **Editing Tasks**: Modify existing tasks by selecting them, entering the new task, and clicking the "EDIT TASK" button.
- **Deleting Tasks**: Remove individual tasks by selecting them and clicking the "DELETE TASK" button, or clear the entire list with the "DELETE ALL TASKS" button.

## Implementation

### Requirements
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Libraries**: Necessary Python libraries (`tkinter`, `sqlite3`) should be available.

### Running the Application
1. **Execution**: Run the Python script `todo_list.py`.
2. **Interface**: The To-Do List application window will open.
3. **Adding Tasks**: Enter tasks and click "ADD" to add them to the list.
4. **Managing Tasks**: Select a task to mark as done, edit, or delete using the respective buttons.
5. **Deleting Tasks**: Use the "DELETE TASK" button for individual tasks or "DELETE ALL TASKS" to clear the entire list.

### Additional Notes
- **Database Management**: The application uses SQLite to store tasks. A file named `AllTasks.db` manages the tasks.
- **Task Status**: Completed tasks have a "âœ”" symbol at the beginning of their description.
- **Image Files**: Ensure the necessary image files (`to_do_list_icon.ico`, `topbar.png`) are in the script's directory.

## Conclusion

The To-Do List application offers a simple yet effective way to manage tasks. Contributions are welcome to enhance functionality, improve the user interface, or fix any issues.
